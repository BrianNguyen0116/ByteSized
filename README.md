### Instructions:
If you're using an IDE, you are able to run the main class that is src/guiMain/Main.java. The dependencies are all covered by the project so there should be no error compiling.

When launching the program, the two examples of accounts available are: [Username: asd Password: asd] and [Username: admin Password: nimda]. There are many more but they are relatively the same but are distinct from eachother. One for user access and the other for admin access respectively. These accounts can be found in users.json.

When using coupons, the ones available to test and try are GRANDOPENING and ANNIVERSARY. These coupons have different discount percentages as well as expiration dates to showcase its function.

Using these accounts will allow the user to interact with the ordering GUI.
